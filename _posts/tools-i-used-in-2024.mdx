## Dev Tools

### [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

Cursor is a fork of vscode with amazing AI features. They really understand the concept of using ai as a tool is the way, not a replacement (i.e. Devin)

### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) (Mac App)

This is like mac shortcuts and hotkeys premium. This helps switch contexts so much faster. Never use Command+Tab again...

### [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/)

I could never find the right browser or tab manager until Zen. Zen is comes with two things I found extremely useful. A great tab manager, and Zen preview, which lets you look and interact with a page without openening another tab. This may not seem significant but seriously out of all these tools, try this one! It's open source and comes with community Mods as well. This will let you search so much more clearly and faster. 

[Arc](https://arc.net/) is also worth mentioning, its pretty similar but with a larger company behind it, which may be good or bad depending on your preference.

### [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

Ruff is a python linter I perfer.

### Excalidraw

My goto for whiteboarding and sketching diagrams.

### Octotab (Chrome Extension)

Octotab is a chrome extension that helps you save and manage your windows and tabs. It's great, but still in its early stages, Let me know if you have any other recommendations.

### [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) (Mac App)

Rectangle is a window manager for mac. It's great for quickly sizing and moving windows around.

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) & [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

These are note taking, task management tools. Organization skills is a key to success.

### [Grep.app](https://grep.app/)

Grep.app is a tool that allows you to search through codebases. I've found it great if you're using a low documentated library or very structured code.
