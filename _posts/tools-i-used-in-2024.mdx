## Dev Tools

### [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

Cursor is a fork of vscode with amazing AI features. They really understand the concept of using ai as a tool is the way, not a replacement (i.e. Devin)

### [Grep.app](https://grep.app/)

Grep.app is a tool that allows you to search through codebases. I've found it great if you're using a low documentated library or very structured code.

### [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

Ruff is a python linter I perfer.

### Excalidraw

My goto for whiteboarding and sketching diagrams.

## Non-Dev Tools

### Octotab (Chrome Extension)

Octotab is a chrome extension that helps you save and manage your windows and tabs. It's great, but still in its early stages, Let me know if you have any other recommendations.

### [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) (Mac App)

Rectangle is a window manager for mac. It's great for quickly sizing and moving windows around.

### Epic Pen (Mac App)

Epic Pen allows you to draw directly on your screen. Available for atleast Mac. 

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) & [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

These are note taking, task management tools. Organization skills is a key to success.

### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) (Mac App)

Productivity tool that allows you to quickly search your computer. This is also early but looks promising.
