## Prompt Thing

[Prompt Thing](https://www.promptthing.dev/) is a free tool that helps you create better prompts quicker and easier. Often times I've found myself taking more time writing out prompts and guidelines than it takes to actually generate the answer. With this tool, people can find commonnly used well crafted prompts inject their own variables and quickly generate a lot of work in the matter of minutes.

Amazon Bedrock has a similar tool integrated into aws. 

### Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering has rapidly evolved into a critical skill in AI development, enabling users to optimize outputs from language models. As AI becomes more integrated into everyday tasks, the ability to craft effective prompts—whether for code generation, content creation, or complex problem-solving—saves time and improves results. Check out this guide for a [deeper dive](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)

## How to use it:

First your going to search for a prompt you would like to use. Say I was going to create a new company, there is a set of prompts related to create a new company. First select the prompt you want to use.

Then you can update variables with your own values, you can also add your own variables. Most variables are common to all prompts, but some are specific to the prompt you are using.
