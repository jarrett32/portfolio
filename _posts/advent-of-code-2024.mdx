[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using code is a series of small programming puzzles released every day at 9:00pm PST until Christmas. It's a great way to solve fun challenges and practice programming fundamentals. It's even more fun discussing or doing it with friends!

Join my private leaderboard with code: `3845617-8e171525`

I&apos;m looking for friends to pair program these with me using VSCode Live Share. Contact me at `j8thomps@ucsd.edu` if you&apos;re interested!
