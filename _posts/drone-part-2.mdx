### iOS App  

- Allows users to control the drone through simple, interactive commands.  
- Supports pre-coded commands for complex flight patterns and maneuvers.  

### Server Application  

- Manages commands from the iOS app and sends them to the Pixhawk.  
- Utilizes a **DroneControl class** to queue and execute commands sequentially for smooth operation.  
- Designed for real-time performance, error handling, and system resiliency.  

### Connectivity  

- Operates through a mobile hotspot, allowing the drone to be controlled anywhere within range.

## Update  

- Initial test flights revealed an imbalance in motor lift, leading to a crash.  
- Future steps include balancing the drone using a controller before introducing pre-coded routes.
