## Introduction



### Some Common Approaches

Lightweight:
**YOLO** is a popular object detection model that is used to detect objects in images. It is known for being extremely fast while maintaining high accuracy.
**SSD** is a similar model to YOLO, one of its competitors.
**CNN** classify images to a single label. They are also pretty fast and used for behavior classification.

Heavyweight:
**DETR** is a transformer based model that is used to detect objects in images. Transformers do ???
**ViT** is a transformer based model to classify images to a single label.

**These heavier models are very accurate, at the cost of more compute and inference time. There is an intense wave of research dedicated to making these models faster while maintaining accuracy. It feels like a new paper every week its impossible to keep up**
