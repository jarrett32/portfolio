## Abstract

Quantum resistant cryptosystems is a method of encrypting messages which cannot be
cracked by a quantum computer. Here we take a look at two quantum 
resistant cryptosystems that are the round three finilists of the NIST 
post quantum cryptography challenge. First we will look to see how 
code based cryptosystem will work called the McEliece cryptosystem. In the 
Second part we will take a look at NTRU cryptosystem which is lattice-based.
